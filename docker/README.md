# Frontend Dev Container

The image provides environment and tools for frontend development. It supports `typescript`, node-v8.11-LTS, `parcel`, `gulp`, `bower`, fully configured `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh`, modern vim i.e. `neovim` with support for typescript, `html`, `scss`, `less`, `css`, `golang`, etc.

**zsh** uses [**zgen**](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) for plugin management, while the **neovim** uses [**vim-plug**](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

Would soon include configuration credits for dotfiles
